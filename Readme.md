# Protocol Oriented Coordinators

These are the resulting playgrounds of my talk at [SwiftConf 2016](https://swiftconf.com), [do iOS 2016](http://do-ios.com) and [CodeMobile 2017](http://www.codemobile.co.uk)

To play around with it, airdrop the `SwiftConf.playgroundbook`, `do iOS.playgroundbook` or `CodeMobile.playgroundbook` to you iPad running iOS 10 with Swift Playgrounds installed and it will automatically open.

Because Playground Books aren't compatible with the latest XCode, the files `SwiftConf XCode.playground`, `do iOS XCode.playground` and `CodeMobile XCode.playground` contain an XCode compatible version of the playground to play around with the code on the Mac. Unfortunately `UIImagePickerController` isn't working in XCode, so you have to use the iOS version to get that to work.

The Coordinator pattern is inspired on a talk by [Soroush Khanlou at NSSpain](https://vimeo.com/144116310).
